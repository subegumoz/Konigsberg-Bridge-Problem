        <p>In the 18th century, the city of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) had four land areas connected by seven bridges. People wondered: is it possible to walk through the city, crossing each bridge exactly once?</p>

        <p>In 1736, mathematician Leonhard Euler approached the problem in a new way. He represented land areas as points (vertices) and bridges as lines (edges). This abstraction led him to an important point: such a path is only possible if there are zero or two points with an odd number of bridges.</p>

        <p>But in Königsberg, all four had an odd number, making the riddle impossible to solve. Euler's work led to the foundation for graph theory, a branch of mathematics that explores how things connect, from cities and networks to social relationships.</p>

        <p>I can hear you wondering: But what is graph theory?</p>
