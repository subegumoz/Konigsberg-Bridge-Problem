Graph theory is the study of networks made of points (called vertices) and the lines that connect them (called edges). Each point has a degree, which means how many lines are connected to it. One important idea is the Euler path — a path that uses every line exactly once. This is only possible if there are zero or two points with an odd number of lines. If all points have even numbers, the path can also return to where it started, and that's called an Euler circuit. In the Königsberg problem, all four points have an odd number of lines, so it's not possible to find a path that crosses each bridge just once. Euler’s idea helped create graph theory, which helps us understand how things are connected in many different systems. </p>
